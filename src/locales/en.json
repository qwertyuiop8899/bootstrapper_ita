In plain English, the debrid service acts as a middleman between the BitTorrent tracker and you, so you download the content directly from their servers at high speed. Most of the content is already cached, meaning you can instantly access it.",
  "faq_debrid_desc2": "Main benefits:",
  "faq_debrid_benefit1": "High-speed downloads, no buffering. Yes, including 4K content (your experience might vary based on your internet connection).",
  "faq_debrid_benefit2": "If you live in a country where internet providers monitor torrent activity, you are safe with one and there is no need for a VPN to stream.",
  "faq_debrid_benefit3": "Content may still be accessible even if the original source is no longer available.",
  "faq_debrid_benefit4": "A small cost gets you a Netflix-like experience for as little as US$3 per month.",
